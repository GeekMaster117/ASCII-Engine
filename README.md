ASCII-Engine
--------------------------------------------------------------
HOW IT WORKS:-

-> Both the library for C programming language and jar file for Java programming language provide various methods to implement simple ASCII graphics.

-> The library for C programming language only provides functions that can be called.

-> The jar file for Java programming language provides the same functions available in the library for C programming language but puts similar methods into a class.

--------------------------------------------------------------
ADVANTAGES OF ASCII Engine.h over ASCII Engine.jar:-

-> Has over twice the features compared to the other.

-> Can be used with or without compiling .h file into .a file, enhancing flexibility.

-> Computational speed bottlenecks at a much higher refresh rate compared to the other, leading to flexibility of usage of higher refresh rates.

-> All the features can be used irrespective of the operating system.

--------------------------------------------------------------
ADVANTAGES OF ASCII Engine.jar over ASCII Engine.h:-

-> Has better organisation by putting similar methods into a class than the other, increasing workflow.

-> Provides robust customised exceptions to handle any which occur during runtime.

-> Decreases the no.of lines required for initialisation as constructors in classes take care of it.

-> Does not have to be compiled to enhance speed unlike the other.
